				<h2>Batman</h2>
				<p>Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and owner of Wayne Enterprises. After witnessing the murder of his parents Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne as a child, he swore vengeance against criminals, an oath tempered by a sense of justice. Bruce Wayne trains himself physically and intellectually and crafts a bat-inspired persona to fight crime.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman-Wikipedia" target="_blank">Read more</a></p>

				<h2>Deadpool</h2>
				<p>The character's back-story has been presented as vague and subject to change, and within the narrative he is unable to remember his personal history due to a mental condition. Whether or not his name was even Wade Wilson is subject to speculation since one of his nemeses, T-Ray, claims in Deadpool #33 that he is the real Wade Wilson and that Deadpool is a vicious murderer who stole his identity. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool" target="_blank">Read more</a></p>

				<h2>Hulk</h2>
				<p>During the experimental detonation of a gamma bomb, scientist Robert Bruce Banner saves teenager Rick Jones who has driven onto the testing field; Banner pushes Jones into a trench to save him, but is hit with the blast, absorbing massive amounts of gamma radiation. He awakens later seemingly unscathed, but that night transforms into a lumbering grey form. A pursuing soldier dubs the creature a "hulk". <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_(comics)" target="_blank">read more</a></p>
